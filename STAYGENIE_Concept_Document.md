# STAYGENIE — Concept Document

> **The AI Real Estate Advisor Morocco Needs**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**STAYGENIE** is an AI-first living and property investment platform designed for Morocco's fragmented real estate ecosystem. Unlike existing platforms that merely list properties, STAYGENIE acts as a **proactive AI advisor** — guiding renters, property owners, investors, institutional fund managers, and property management agencies through every step of their journey.

The platform is powered by **6 specialized AI engines** that handle everything from natural language property search in Darija, French, and English, to automatic government subsidy eligibility checks, investment analysis, contract intelligence, and property management automation.

**Core thesis:** Existing platforms are **databases**. STAYGENIE is an **advisor**. That's the fundamental difference.

## 2. The Problem

Morocco's housing ecosystem is broken. The current experience is fragmented, opaque, and frustrating for everyone involved.

### Today's Reality

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| **50+ websites** to browse manually | Hours wasted searching across Avito, Mubawab, Facebook groups |
| **Scams & fake listings** everywhere | No verification system — stolen photos, ghost landlords |
| **Landlords don't answer** calls | No centralized communication or response tracking |
| **Nobody knows about government subsidies** | 94,000 families benefited from Daam Sakane in 2024, but thousands more still qualify and don't know it |
| **Weeks or months** to find a home | Process takes 3-6 weeks on average for renters |
| **Investing = guesswork & fear** | No ROI tools, no risk scoring, no subsidy awareness for buyers |
| **Hidden costs, confusing contracts** | Renters sign contracts they don't understand; no legal protection awareness |

### STAYGENIE's Solution

- **One AI conversation** replaces 50 websites
- AI **handles all communication** with landlords and agents
- Every listing is **verified & scored** for trust
- AI **discovers subsidies instantly** (Daam Sakane, FOGARIM)
- Home found in **days, not weeks**
- **Data-driven investment analysis** with transparent reasoning
- Full **transparency** with AI-explained contracts
